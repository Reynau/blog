    <p>It started as a normal day: I woke up at 8 AM, did some stuff and then I took the bus to go to the university. Once arrived at my workplace,  I started to finish some of the unfinished documentation that I left during all that time I’ve been working here. But then, the special day started.</p>
<p>I met up with a young teacher I had a year before that just started working here, and we went to buy some food and drink to celebrate both starting and ending. We bought four different kinds of chips, olives, and pizza. Once the appetizer was ready, we called all our workmates to taste our assortment. They arrived earlier than I expected. Of course, the food was the main reason.</p>
<p>Was the moment for the speeches: Mentors, project managers, workmates… A lot of people was here. I felt a little sad when I remembered that I was not going to share my time daily with all that people anymore. Once we finished our speeches, a printed shirt flight to my hands. It was the shirt, the most epic shirt I’ve ever seen.</p>

<p>Really impressive, guys. Thank you all for all that time we spent working, laughing, eating and playing together!</p>
